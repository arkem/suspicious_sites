# What is this?
A public JSON collection of suspicious sites to help raise community awareness. These are links we've seen in the wild that attempt to steal credentials or lead to malicious sites. Never visit these sites without proper caution, and never enter any account details into them.

# How can I submit more information?

### There are a few options

* Create an issue in this github project, and I'll pull it into the JSON file and do some digging into the website
* Fork the repo, edit the JSON file, and submit a pull request. Include as much information as possible, but please at least inlucde the URL. Validate your JSON before submitting [Link](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com)
* Send me a tweet on Twitter and I'll do the rest: [@RiotGradius](https://twitter.com/riotgradius)

# What does this project power?

* [Suspious Site List](http://www.grds.pw/suspicious_sites/)
* Other projects to come, maybe a twitter bot or something?

# Suggestions?

Feel free to submit an issue to this repo, help this project grow into something awesome.
